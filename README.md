# Data Journalism

### Background 
In this Monash University Data Analytics Boot Camp/Trilogy Education Services homework, I imagined that I'd just accepted a data visualisation position for a major metro paper. I was tasked with analysing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wanted to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She was counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System.
